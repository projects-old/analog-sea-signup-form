Thinkful Exercise - AnalogSea Signup Form

The Scenario: AnalogSea Signup Form
You're freelancing for a cloud computing startup called AnalogSea. The task for today is to code up the first version (aka, v1) of a simple account creation page based on the designs below. For v1, the client wants clean, SEO and accessibility friendly HTML. They're providing you with a design file and a list of requirements for the form, and by end of day, you need to deliver a live version of the page they can preview on GitHub pages.

This is my version of the analog-sea-signup-form exercise: https://projects-old.github.io/analog-sea-signup-form/
